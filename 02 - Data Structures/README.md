# Data Structures
## Week 1 - Basic Data Structures
### Description
In this module, you will learn about the basic data structures used throughout the rest of this course. We start this module by looking in detail at the fundamental building blocks: arrays and linked lists. From there, we build up two important data structures: stacks and queues. Next, we look at trees: examples of how they’re used in Computer Science, how they’re implemented, and the various ways they can be traversed. Once you’ve completed this module, you will be able to implement any of these data structures, as well as have a solid understanding of the costs of the operations, as well as the tradeoffs involved in using each data structure.
### Learning Objectives
    List the basic data structures
    Analyze operations with data structures
    Choose appropriate basic data structure for a task at hand
    Apply basic data structures in programming challenges
    Develop a program that simulates network packet processing

## Week 2 – Dynamic Arrays and Amortized Analysis
### Description
In this module, we discuss Dynamic Arrays: a way of using arrays when it is unknown ahead-of-time how many elements will be needed. Here, we also discuss amortized analysis: a method of determining the amortized cost of an operation over a sequence of operations. Amortized analysis is very often used to analyse performance of algorithms when the straightforward analysis produces unsatisfactory results, but amortized analysis helps to show that the algorithm is actually efficient. It is used both for Dynamic Arrays analysis and will also be used in the end of this course to analyze Splay trees.
### Learning Objectives
    Describe how dynamic arrays work
    Calculate amortized running time of operations
    List the methods for amortized analysis
